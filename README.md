# Dataset for 'Novel high-resolution data to unravel distribution, mechanisms and anthropogenic threats to global aquatic macrophytes'

## code_aquatic

The folder contains all the plotting code for non-map figures in the main text.

## MacrophytesDistribution1Degree

This folder contains all the maps used in the main text, saved in ​​SHP format​​ and compatible with ​​ArcGIS​​. To visualize the ​​1-degree grid diversity hotspot map for aquatic macrophytes​​, link the 1-degree grid map with the file ​​'species_distribtion.csv'​​. 

**1degree_map** The 1-degree grid map used in the main text.
